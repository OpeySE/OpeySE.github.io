    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standardized system for tagging text files. Markup languages are designed for processing and presenting text. HTML is a widely known markup language. HTML5 is a markup language that is used for structuring content
      for the World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <h2>Design philosophy of HTML5</h2>
    <p>
      HTML5 has many design philosophy which has contributed to its success. I plan to talk about the three key design philosophies, which I found fascinating. The first design philosophy stated that HTML5 should support existing content. The second philosophy
      states that HTML5 should not try and reinvent the wheel. This philosophy is key. A great example would be if there is a widespread method, which developers use to accomplish a task it should not be changed. In other words, this philosophy can be
      summarised by the statement if it is not broken don't fix it. The last philosophy states you should not worry too much about theoretical problems if it would increase the time period until the user gets the product. This is philosophy can be summarised
      as the priority of constituencies, which states in case of conflicts consider the users over authors, implementers, specifiers and theories.
    </p>
    <h2>Doctype and meta tag</h2>
    <p>
      At the start of an HTML5 page, you will see the document type declaration(DOCTYPE). Document type declaration is a set of instructions, which are used to inform browsers about the type of HTML page. Document type declaration helps the web browser to read the web page correctly.

      Meta tags are used to provide information about the page description. For my website, I used a meta tag to inform browsers about the charset, which is set to UTF-8. The charset which is also called character set is used to display a page correctly, it
      consists of 128 different alphanumeric characters. The Unicode Transformation Format(UTF) is used for encoding Unicode. The encoding has a variable length and uses an 8-bit code unit. Unicode is an international encoding standard.
    </p>
    <h2>Semantic elements</h2>

    <p>
      The header element contains information for introduction of the web page and it can be normally found at the top of a webpage. The nav semantic element is used to hold information for navigation. The section element is used to group information together.
      For example we would expect the contact information to be placed inside a section, because contact information would contain several methods of contacts e.g. phone number, social media addresses and email address. The article element would hold
      self-sufficient content as a result the article element should not need external information for it to make sense. You should be able to read an article element without needing to read the whole web page. The footer element contains informations,
      which will be placed at the bottom of a web page. The footer element normally contains copyright information, contact information and the author of the web page.
