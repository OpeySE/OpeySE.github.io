    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Before the creation of my website I thought it would be wise for me to analyse and evaluate different websites. The objective was to identify areas of a website, which has lead to its success.
    </p>
    <h2>Research of different website</h2>
    <p>
      After viewing a wide range of websites I choose to analyse and evaluate the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/?cid=oas-emeia-domains-apple.co.uk">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/">Samsung</a> and
      <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/&refURL=&referrer=#311963e12254">Forbes</a> website.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apple website uses a contrast of colours and high-quality pictures. The apple website has a minimal amount of text, therefore each picture is key. Around most of the pictures, there is a little bit of text. The text is used to persuade the user to
      look into the picture and as a result, most pictures can be clicked. If the picture can not clickable, there normally a hyperlink. The Apple website is visually appealing and simple to navigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Samsung website also uses a contrast of colours to create visually appealing pages. The navigation bar has two pictures and the logo. This is not unique to the Samsung website because the Apple navigation uses the same format. Looking at other websites
      it is common to see the logo and one or more pictures in the navigation bar. The Samsung website doesnâ€™t have any text on the edges of the pages instead, it leaves it empty. This allows the user to keep their eyes around the same area and keeps
      the information received to a minimal.

      Unlike the other two websites, the Forbes website has adverts. According to Emily Winsauer having adverts on your website is fine, if it reaches certain requirements. One of the requirement states that the videos should not autoplay, but some of Forbes
      adverts do autoplay. I found this distracting especially when I was reading an article, but the good thing about the videos that did autoplay is that they were muted.
