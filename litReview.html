    <h1>Mitigating​ ​corporate​ ​information exposure​ ​on​ ​the​ ​web</h1>
    <p>
      I​ ​have​ ​identified​ ​five ​key​ ​area​s ​that​ ​can​ ​significantly​ ​mitigate​ ​corporate​ information​ ​exposure​ ​on the​ ​web.​ ​In​ ​this​ ​paper,​ ​I​ ​have​ ​evaluated​ ​problems, ​​which​ ​can​ ​lead​ ​to​ ​corporate​ ​information exposure​
      ​on​ ​the​ ​web.​ ​The​ ​problems​ ​include​ ​firewall design,​ ​malware,​ ​insiders​ ​activities​ ​and phishing.​ ​The​ ​main ​result​ ​of​ ​this​ ​paper​ ​is​ ​to​ ​prove​ ​that​ ​every​ ​one​ ​of​ ​these​ ​problems​ ​has​ ​a strategy,​ ​which​ ​if​
      ​applied​ ​should​ ​mitigate​ ​corporate​ ​information​ ​exposure​ ​on​ ​the​ ​web.
    </p>

    <h2>Firewalls</h2>
    <p>
      There are many ways, which corporate information can be leaked onto the internet. The lack of a well-designed firewall can lead to unauthorised access. Firewalls are packet filters,which are placed where a private network is connected to the internet.
      Firewalls seize every packet that is exchanged between a private network and the internet. Subsequently, firewalls examine the packets to assess whether it should be discarded or accepted. The examination of a firewall would depend on the specified
      sequences of rules, which is set by the firewall designer. The following paper has examined firewalls implementation in public clouds and focused on the major providers. This paper concluded that the firewalls offered by the major providers have
      a solid base of protection for cyber-physical systems. (Ullrich, J., Cropper, J., Frühwirt, P., & Weippl, E. (2016), p.19). The impending paper used the general architecture of the ALSD firewall, to assess whether it would be able to prevent leakages
      of sensitive data on an android phone. It concluded that it provides a strong protection against leakages of sensitive data. (Ammari, N., El Mrabti, A. A., El Kalam, A. A., & Ouahman, A. A. (2016),p.1230)
    </p>

    <h2>Malware and Anti-Malware</h2>
    <p>
      Corporate information can be leaked through malware infection, which can give unauthorised access. Malware is an abbreviation of malicious software. Malware is designed to gain access or damage a computer without the knowledge of the owner. Common examples
      of malware consist of viruses, worms, trojan horses and spyware. Anti-malware is a software program designed to detect, prevent and solve malicious programs. The following paper states that malicious objects spread quickly through an unprotected
      network and corrupts data. (Misra, A. K., Verma, M., & Sharma, A. (2014), p.340). The antimalware in this paper reduces the attack rate, invasion rate and replication potential of malicious malware objects. The antimalware can be used to create
      an infection-free network and the nature of the anti-malware is to prevent malware attacks. (Misra, A. K., Verma, M., & Sharma, A. (2014), p.347).
    </p>

    <h2>Insider Threat</h2>
    <p>
      A corporation is an organisation run by a group of people who act as a single entity. An insider is a person who releases unauthorised information. The following paper states that insider threat is one of the most dangerous security problems. (Ambre,
      A., & Shekokar, N. (2015),p.433). Additionally, the following paper states that insider threat is a unique problem and can never be eliminated. (Sarkar, K. R., (2010), p.112). On the other hand, this paper states that there are several solutions
      to avoid data leakages and prevent corporate exposure.(Bose, N., & Vishwanath, N. (2016), p.01).
    </p>
    <p>
      The specified paper states that a log file monitor is a valuable tool, which can find the probability of malicious activity. It concludes that using log files it can detect insider activities. (Ambre, A., & Shekokar, N. (2015),p.445). The given paper
      highlights key strategies which corporation should apply to prevent data leakages. Firstly, the monitoring of system call activity can serve as a great tool to indicate mischievous behaviour. (Bose, N., & Vishwanath, N. (2016), p.01) Secondly, a
      document control system should be placed in a corporation, who wants to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive documents. (Bose, N., & Vishwanath, N. (2016), p.02). Thirdly, the given paper goes on to say that a data leakage prevention systems
      should be used in corporations to prevent data exposure. Data leakage prevention (DLP) are tactics, which are used to prevent potential breaches. It is done by monitoring and storing data. The study states that DLP would cause anyone who wants to
      access the system to have a login. This would allow the organisation to have a database of who logins into the system and what time they log in. (Bose, N., & Vishwanath, N. (2016), p.04). Another paper concludes that DLPSs are increasingly recognised
      preferred solutions for identifying, monitoring and protecting confidential data. (Alneyadi, S., Sithirasenan, E., & Muthukkumarasamy, V. (2016). p.150)
    </p>

    <h2>Phishing</h2>
    <p>
      Phishing is the process of obtaining unauthorised sensitive information by disguising it as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. The following article states that phishing attacks are causing billions of dollars and are at an all-time
      high. An organisation should use a rule-based training system, which should teach employees how to identify and avoid phishing attacks. (Jensen, M. L., Dinger, M., Wright, R. T., & Thatcher, J. B. (2017) p.597-598.). On the other hand, this paper
      states that it is reasonable to assume that attackers will adopt their phishing toolkit in the future. It urges researching organisations to pay attention to phishing attacks. (Zhao, R., John, S., Karas, S., Bussell, C., Roberts, J., Six, D., ...
      & Yue, C. (2017). p.646)
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      There are several ways which corporate information exposure on the web can be mitigated. This paper discusses different strategies that if applied to an organisation it should mitigate the chances of corporate exposure on the web. The use of firewalls
      was assessed and concluded that they provide a strong protection against data exposure. Malware and anti-malware are evaluated and this paper concludes that the nature of anti-malware is preventive of malware attacks. The assessment of insiders
      are evaluated and the paper shows key strategies that if applied should prevent and reduce insiders activities. This paper defines and evaluates phishing. It assesses a prevention strategy, which applied it should mitigate corporate information
      exposure on the web.
