    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I have created this website for my Web Foundation(WebF1) coursework.
      The coursework requires me to design a website and add a discovery
      log. The website should also contain my previous coursework, which was to
      write a literature review about mitigating corporate exposure on the web.
      The picture above shows an explorer which is a representation of you, the
      reader. As you explore my website I hope you enjoy the journey and you
      find it insightful.
